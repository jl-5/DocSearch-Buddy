# DocSearch Buddy
A React app that allows users to find which documents contain text.

The app is hosted here: https://jl-5.github.io/DocSearch-Buddy/

Upload documents using the "Choose Files" button. Currently supported file types are PDF and TXT. Once files are uploaded, they will highlight green if they contain the text in the search box.
